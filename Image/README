This is our own custom version image for the BrickPi.  It's a modified "Wheezy" with a few changes:

This version is setup to:
	- Boot to desktop.
	- Accept a US keyboard (GO USA!)
	- SSH Enabled with default login (pi, raspberry)
	- VNC Login on Port 1, password raspberr
	- Auto connect for wlan 
	- Auto static IP
	
Most importantly to note, for the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the BrickPi, the following changes have been made to Wheezy:
	- A modified version of Wiring Pi is installed.
	- The UART clock speed is set to init_uart_clock=32000000
	- Serial and I2C is enabled.
