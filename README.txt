This project combines the brains of a Raspberry Pi with the brawn of a LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT.  

The board firmware is made in Arduino in order to make it super-hackable.  The firmware is written in Arduino 1.0 and can be uploaded via an ISP programmer.

The board supports NXT motors and NXT sensors, as well as many of Dexter Industries sensors for LEGO Mindstorms.

The current version does NOT support the Ultrasonic sensor.
