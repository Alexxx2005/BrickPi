The board firmware is made in Arduino in order to make it super-hackable.  The firmware is written in Arduino 1.0 and can be uploaded via an ISP programmer.  It can also be uploaded with an Arduino Uno, with an adapter explained in this repository.

The board supports LEGO NXT motors and LEGO NXT sensors, as well as many of Dexter Industries sensors for LEGO Mindstorms.
