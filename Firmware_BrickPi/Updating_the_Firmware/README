We have a step-by-step version of this on our website here:

http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/design/firmware-documentation/flash-new-firmware/


Before you Begin:

- We have the latest version of the firmware compiled in this directory (the .hex file), for your convenience.
- Make sure avrdude is installed on your computer.  Preferably installed in the PATH keywords so you can operate avrdude out of any directory.
- Install ArduinoISP Sketch on your Arduino.
- Connect D10 to the appropriate reset line on the BrickPi.
- Change the values for the COM port in both of the batch files.
- Be sure to verify you're programming to the correct Microcontroller (UC1 vs UC2)!

Steps:
	- Remove the BrickPi from the Rapberry Pi.  Remove power sources from the BrickPi.
	- Connect Arduino to the Raspberry Pi.  Connect the ISP as shown int he picture, and connect the reset line to D10 and the appropriate microntroller reset hole.
	- Update the .BAT file with the appropriate COM#.
	- Begin the .BAT file operation.
	- You will need to press return after each sequence (there are 6 sequences: 3 fuse writes, two memory writes, and one eeprom write).
