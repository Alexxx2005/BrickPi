Setup Files

Files you will need to modify your Raspberry Pi for operation with the BrickPi.

For those using Raspberry Pi 3, you will need to disable bluetooth. The way Raspberry Pi 3 uses Bluetooth causes issues with BrickPi. Before you install the drivers, execute the following commands.

Edit the boot config with

1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt
2. add "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt" to the end of the file
3. save the file
4. run "sudo systemctl disable hciuart" to prevent BT modem from attempting to use UART
5. reboot raspberry pi
